# browserbox

IMAP client for browsers

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/whiteout-io/browserbox.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/whiteout-io/browserbox)

## StringEncoding API

This module requires `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder` to exist as part of the StringEncoding API (see: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI/Encoding_API) [whatwg.org](http://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#api)). Firefox 19+ is basically the only browser that supports this at the time of writing, while [Chromium in canary, not stable](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=243354). Luckily, [there is a polyfill](https://github.com/whiteout-io/stringencoding)!

Depending on your browser, you might need [this polyfill for ArrayBuffer #slice](https://github.com/ttaubert/node-arraybuffer-slice), e.g. phantomjs.

## TCPSocket API

There is a [shim](https://github.com/whiteout-io/tcp-socket) that brings [Mozilla-flavored](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI/TCP_Socket) version of the [Raw Socket API](http://www.w3.org/TR/raw-sockets/) to Chromium.

## Installation

### [Bower](http://bower.io/):

    bower install git@github.com:whiteout-io/browserbox.git#0.1.0

### [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/):

    npm install https://github.com/whiteout-io/browserbox/tarball/0.1.0

## Usage

### AMD

Require [browserbox.js](src/browserbox.js) as `browserbox`

### Global context

Include following fileson the page.

```html
<script src="browserbox.js"></script>
<script src="browserbox-special-use.js"></script>
<script src="browserbox-imap.js"></script>
```

This exposes the constructor `BrowserBox` as a global variable

## API

    var BrowserBox = require('browserbox')

## Create connection to an IMAP server

```
new BrowserBox(host[, port][, options]) â†’ IMAP client object
```

Where

  * **host** is to hostname to connect to
  * **port** (optional) is the port to connect to (defaults to 143)
  * **options** (optional) is the options object
    * **auth** is the authentication information object
      * **user** is the username of the user (also applies to Oauth2)
      * **pass** is the password of the user
      * **xoauth2** is the OAuth2 access token to be used instead of password
    * **id** (optional) is the identification object for [RFC2971](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2971#section-3.3) (ex. `{name: "myclient", version: "1"}`)
    * **useSSL** (optional) enables TLS
    * **ca** (optional) (only in conjunction with this [TCPSocket shim](https://github.com/whiteout-io/tcp-socket)) if you use TLS, pin a PEM-encoded certificate as a string

Example

```javascript
var client = browserbox("localhost", 143, {
    auth: {
        user: "testuser",
        pass: "testpass"
    },
    id: {
        name: "My Client",
        version: "0.1"
    }
});
```

## Initiate connection

BrowserBox object by default does not initiate the connection, you need to call `client.connect()` to establish it

    client.connect();

This function does not take any arguments and does not return anything. See the events section to handle connection issues.

## Events

The IMAP client has several events you can attach to by setting a listener

### onerror

Is fired when something unexpected happened.

```
client.onerror = function(err){}
```

Where

  * **err** is an error object

### onclose

Is fired when the connection to the IMAP server is closed.

```
client.onerror = function(err){}
```

### onauth

Is fired when the user is successfully authenticated

## List mailboxes

List all mailboxes with `listMailboxes()` method

```
client.listMailboxes(callback)
```

Where

  * **callback** is the callback function with the following arguments
    * **err** is an error object, only set if the request failed
    * **mailboxes** is an object with the mailbox structure

Mailbox object is with the following structure

  * **root** (boolean) `true` if the node is root
  * **name** (string) unicode decoded name of the mailbox
  * **path** (string) full path to the mailbox
  * **delimiter** (string) path delimiting symbol
  * **listed** (boolean) mailbox was found in the LIST response
  * **subscribed** (boolean) mailbox was found in the LSUB response
  * **specialUse** (string) mailbox was identified as a special use mailbox ("\Trash", "\Sent", "\Junk" etc. see [RFC6154](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6154#section-2))
  * **flags** (array) a list of flags
  * **children** (array) a list of child mailboxes

Example

```javascript
client.listMailboxes(function(err, mailboxes){
    console.log(err || mailboxes);
});
```

```json
{
  "root": true,
  "children": [
    {
      "name": "INBOX",
      "delimiter": "/",
      "path": "INBOX",
      "children": [],
      "flags": ["\\HasNoChildren"],
      "listed": true,
      "subscribed": true
    },
    {
      "name": "[Gmail]",
      "delimiter": "/",
      "path": "[Gmail]",
      "flags": ["\\Noselect","\\HasChildren"],
      "listed": true,
      "subscribed": true,
      "children": [
        {
          "name": "All Mail",
          "delimiter": "/",
          "path": "[Gmail]/All Mail",
          "children": [],
          "flags": ["\\HasNoChildren","\\All"],
          "listed": true,
          "specialUse": "\\All",
          "subscribed": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## List namespaces

List available namespaces with `listNamespaces()`. If [NAMESPACE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2342) extension is not supported, the method returns `false`.

```javascript
client.listNamespaces(callback)
```

Where

  * **callback** is the callback function with the following arguments
    * **err** is an error object, only set if the request failed
    * **namespaces** is an object with the namespace values or `false` if NAMESPACE is not supported

Namespace object is with the following structure

  * **personal** is an array of namespace elements or `false` for Personal Namespace
  * **users** is an array of namespace elements or `false` for Other Users' Namespace
  * **shared** is an array of namespace elements or `false` for Shared Namespace

Namespace element object has the following structure

  * **prefix** is the prefix string
  * **delimiter** is the hierarchy delimiter

**NB!** Namespace_Response_Extensions are not supported (extension data is silently skipped)

Namespaces should be checked before attempting to create new mailboxes - most probably creating mailboxes outside personal namespace fails. For example when the personal namespace is prefixed with "INBOX." you can create "INBOX.Sent Mail" but you can't create "Sent Mail".

Example

```javascript
client.listNamespaces(function(err, namespaces){
    console.log(err || namespaces);
});
```

```json
{
    "personal": [
        {
            "prefix": "",
            "delimiter": "/"
        }
    ],
    "users": false,
    "shared": false
}
```

## Select mailbox

Select specific mailbox by path with `selectMailbox()`

```javascript
client.selectMailbox(path[, options], callback)
```

Where

  * **path** is the full path to the mailbox (see *path* property with `listMailboxes`)
  * **options** *optional* options object with the following properties
    * **condstore** if set to `true` adds (CONDSTORE) option when selecting
    * **readOnly** if set to `true` uses `EXAMINE` instead of `SELECT`
  * **callback** is the callback function with the following arguments
    * **err** is an error object, only set if the request failed
    * **mailboxInfo** is an object with mailbox properties
      * **exists** (number) the count of messages in the selected mailbox
      * **flags** (array) an array of flags used in the selected mailbox
      * **permanentFlags** (array) an array of permanent flags available to use in the selected mailbox
      * **readOnly** (boolean) `true` if the mailbox is in read only mode
      * **uidValidity** (number) UIDValidity value
      * **uidNext** (number) predicted next UID value
      * **highestModseq** (number) (with CONDSTORE only) highest modseq value

Example

```javascript
client.selectMailbox("INBOX", function(err, mailbox){
    console.log(err || mailbox);
});
```

```json
{
    "readOnly": false,
    "exists": 6596,
    "flags": [
        "\\Answered",
        "\\Flagged"
    ],
    "permanentFlags": [
        "\\Answered",
        "\\Flagged"
    ],
    "uidValidity": 2,
    "uidNext": 38361,
    "highestModseq": 3682918
}
```

## List messages

List messages with `listMessages()`

```javascript
client.listMessages(sequence, query[, options], callback)
```

Where

  * **sequence** defines the range of sequence numbers or UID values (if `byUid` option is set to true). Example: "1", "1:*", "1,2:3,4" etc.
  * **query** is an array of keys that need to be fetched. Example: ["uid", "flags", "body.peek[headers (date)]"]
  * **options** is an optional options object
    * **byUid** if `true` executes `UID FETCH` instead of `FETCH`
    * **changedSince** is the modseq filter. Only messages with higher modseq value will be returned
  * **callback** is the callback function to run once all me messages are processed with the following arguments
    * **err** is an error object, only set if the request failed
    * .... not implemented

Example

```javascript
client.listMessages("1:10", ["uid", "flags", "body[]"], function(err, ...){
   ... not entirely implemented
});
```

**NB!** this method does not stream the values, you need to handle this by yourself (do not use full "1:*" ranges on mailboxes with unknown size or this might chrash your application).

## Close connection

You can close the connection with `close()`. This method doesn't actually terminate the connection, it sends LOGOUT command to the server.

```javascript
clisne.close();
```

Once the connection is actually closed `onclose` event is fired.

## Get your hands dirty

    git clone git@github.com:whiteout-io/browserbox.git
    cd browserbox
    npm install && npm test

To run the integration tests against a local smtp server

    grunt imap
    add the test folder as a chrome app (chrome settings -> extensions -> check 'developer mode' -> load unpacked extension)
